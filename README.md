# Federant 

Federant revives the Reklameschrift typeface Feder Antiqua by
Otto Ludwig NÃ¤gele (1911).

The main challenge of designing a modern interpretation was to
equilibrate between applying visual corrections for overall
consistency and staying close to the original source. In certain
cases the historical authenticy was sacrificed in favour of an
even typographic color.

This project required research of historic type specimens in
search for the missing letterforms. The unsusual interpretaion of
the Yen currency symbol can be found in typefaces of that period.

Designed by Olexa M. Volochay, Alexei Vanyashin for Cyreal.
 
Federant is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages
that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded
to support other scripts.
